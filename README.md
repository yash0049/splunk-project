Splunk SIEM Log Analysis Projects
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects focused on analyzing various types of logs using Splunk SIEM. Each project provides a structured guide for uploading sample log files, performing field extraction, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and gaining actionable insights from different types of network and application log data.

Projects Overview
Analyzing DNS Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Step-by-step guide for uploading DNS (Domain Name System) log files.

Extract relevant fields, analyze DNS query patterns, detect anomalies, and monitor DNS traffic activity.

Analyzing FTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Walkthrough for analyzing FTP (File Transfer Protocol) log files.

Focuses on extracting key fields, understanding FTP activity patterns, detecting unauthorized transfers, and monitoring FTP traffic trends.

Analyzing HTTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Process for analyzing HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) log data.

Includes uploading sample logs, field extraction, analysis of HTTP request patterns, anomaly detection, and traffic monitoring.

Analyzing SSH Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Comprehensive guide for analyzing SSH (Secure Shell) log files.

Covers extraction of key information, identification of login patterns, detection of brute-force attempts, and correlation of SSH activities with other security events.

Analyzing Tunnel Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Techniques for analyzing tunnel traffic logs (e.g., GRE, IPv4, IPv6) captured from network monitoring tools like Zeek IDS.

Includes analysis of tunnel behaviors, detection of suspicious tunneling activities, and correlation with broader network logs.

Analyzing SMTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Structured approach to analyzing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) logs.

Focuses on email traffic analysis, anomaly detection in email behavior, and monitoring of SMTP-based communication patterns.

Analyzing DHCP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

Guide for analyzing DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) log files.

Covers field extraction, analysis of IP address assignments, detection of unusual DHCP activity, and ongoing DHCP traffic monitoring.

Purpose
These projects aim to build practical skills in using Splunk for security monitoring, threat detection, and incident investigation by working with real-world types of log data.
They are ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their SIEM and cybersecurity analysis capabilities.
